  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold border-b border-gray-300 pb-2 mt-6">About Weather APIs</h2>
  <p class="text-lg mt-2">Our Weather App relies on APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to retrieve weather data from external sources. Here are some key points about the APIs we use:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg mt-2">
    <li>We use reputable weather data providers such as OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, or AccuWeather.</li>
    <li>These APIs offer a wide range of weather data, including current conditions, forecasts, historical data, and more.</li>
    <li>To use these APIs, we've obtained API keys, which are unique identifiers that allow us to access the weather data.</li>
    <li>The APIs provide data in JSON or XML format, which we then parse and display in our app.</li>
  </ul>
